The advanced Rust programming entirely by having you implement 6 linked lists. In doing so, you should learn:

    - The following pointer types: &, &mut, Box, Rc, Arc, *const, *mut, NonNull(?)
    - Ownership, borrowing, inherited mutability, interior mutability, Copy
    - All The Keywords: struct, enum, fn, pub, impl, use, ...
    - Pattern matching, generics, destructors
    - Testing, installing new toolchains, using miri
    - Unsafe Rust: raw pointers, aliasing, stacked borrows, UnsafeCell, variance
